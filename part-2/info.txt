*The continuous integration setup consists of* 

->running unit tests

->building the Docker image that we use to build our service

->running the build container and compiling our service

->building the Docker image that we run and deploy

->pushing the final image to a Docker registry


*About Docker-Compose*

-> Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi
   container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the
   services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.


-> The big advantage of using Compose is you can define your application stack in a file, keep it at the root of your project repo (itâ€™s now version controlled), and easily enable someone else to contribute to your project. Someone would only need to clone your repo and start the compose app. In fact, you might see quite a few projects on GitHub/GitLab doing
 exactly this now.
